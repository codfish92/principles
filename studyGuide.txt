closure: when functions can see the variables within their scope and all scopes above them. The jack and jill example is a good look at this
Lexeme: a symbol or string of valid characters, ie 2 - 1; the lexemes are 2, -, 1, and ;
Syntactical analysis: funny way of saying parser, checks a sequence of tokens and determines if they are valid syntax.
First class function: a function that can accept a function as input and returns that function as a value.
Currying: The act of making a function have access to variables it hasen't defined. it is the act of making a function that takes multiple arguments as chain of functions that only take one argument. 
Right-most derivation: when you try to reduce a the rightmost non terminal first: ie 1 + 2
1-> expr + expr
2-> expr + 2
3-> 1 + 2
Token: the classification of a lexeme. ie 2 - 1;, the lexemes are 2, -, 1 and ;, but the tokens are <int> <operator> <int> ;. The token is not the symbol itself, but general classification of the symbol. 
Sentence: a string of tokens that make gramatical sense in a given grammer. 
Parser: deterimines if a string of tokens is valid, see syntatical anaylsis. 
Lexer: is given a series of characters from an alphabet and determines what type of tokens they are. They do not perform any grammer checks, ie 1++++++ is a valid string of lexemes, but doesn't make any sense in the parser. 
Finite automaton: A statement declaring that there are only a set number of states that you can be in. Regular expression are a good example of this. Other terms for this are finite state machine, state machine.
Regular grammar: A grammer that expresses a formal language, or a language that can be expressed using regular expressions. most regular grammars have the form
S-> A | B | C
A-> a | xS
...

A non regular grammar would be 
S -> x | aSa 
this is because there is no way to have a regualr expression match a string surrounded by an equal number of a's. The only way you could is to have a regex for every possiblity, which is impossible since there are an infinite number of possiblities (ie a non finiite state machine or infinte state machine)
Contex free grammar: Any grammer that has the general form
A -> B | cC | DD
B -> DD | b
...
All regular grammars are contex free, but not all contex free grammars are regular grammars
Pushdown automaton: The way all parsers work, it employs the use of a stack to translate a string of tokens
5+5+10=x; would work like such
(aaa, ab ect are just identifiers for parsing cuz i dont want to make the entire tree)
<stmt> ;
a<expr> = b<expr>
a
aa<expr> + ab<expr> 
aa
aaa<expr> + aab<expr>
aaa
5
aab
5
ab
10
b
x

They essentially recurse into each non terminal.
Production rule: The possible derivations of a symbol, ie <expr> -> <expr> | <expr> + <expr>
High order function: A function that takes a function as input and/or returns a function on output. A derivate is a good example of high order function. ie derivate of x^2 is 2x, in this case x^2 is a function passed as the input and the output is 2x, which is a function
Lexical scope: A funny way of saying the scope of a function or variable. It is the string of all visible variables at that point. 
//scope is (a)
ie func foo(a);
	//scope is (a)
	int b;
	//scope is (a, b)
	func bar();
		int c;
		//scope is (a, b, c)
	end bar
	//scope is (a, b)
	int d;
	//scope is (a, b, d)
	
end foo
//scope is (a)
Regular expression: a finite state machine that returns matched lexemes given rules. ie the regex [0-9]+\.[0-9]+ will match one or more number of digits, followed immediatly by a ., followed immeditetally by one or more digits. the formal definition is grammer for a formal language.
Pairwise-disjoint: this is when you split up all the terminal a production rule will eventually create. if any symbol has duplicate terminals, it is not pairwise disjoint otherwise it is. 
(upper case is non terminal, lower case is terminal)
ie S -> A | B | C | a
A-> a | f
B-> b
C-> c | d | e
S's set is 
{a, f}, {b}, {c, d, e}, {a}
because a appears in two sets, this is not pairwise disjoint 
while 
ie S -> AbC | deF
A-> S | Bbg
B-> t | s | r
C-> S | f
F-> S | de
S's set is 
{t, s, r}, {d}
this means S is pairwise disjoint. 
Alphabet: A set of characters that are valid in a language. ie A is a valid letter in english, but the chinese symbol for dog is not. 
Lexical analysis: The process of turning a string of characters into tokens, ie what a lexer does. 
Referential transparency: the concept of providing a function an input multiple times and getting the exact same output. This applies to variables as well
ie func foo(x)
	x++
	return x
is not referential transperent because if x = 2 and you call foo(x), the output is 3, but if you call foo(x) right after it, you get 4. 
func bar(x)
	temp = x + 1
	return temp
is referential transperent because if x = 2, and you call bar(x) any number of times, it will always return 3, given you havent changed x somewhere else. 
Semantics: The style or convention of something. for instance nothing prevents you from doing this in c
int derp(int x)
					{
	return x++;}
but the general symantics of coding would state you dont do this.
Grammatical ambiguity: when a symbol could reduce down to two or more forms. ie i saw her duck, is an ambiguous phrase becuase duck can be either a noun or the verb. The only way to tell which one it is is to go down a path until you get an answer that makes sense. you would start by assuming duck is a noun, and then try to interperet or parse the sentence. this would not make sense(syntax error) so you change it to a verb. now the sentance makes sense. 
Leftmost derivation: Like right most derivation, execept you reduce the left most non terminal first
ie 1-> <expr> - <expr>
2-><expr> + <expr> - <expr>
3-> 10 + <expr> - <expr>
4-> 10 + 5 - <expr>
5-> 10 + 5 - 7 
this is a left most derivation. 
Dynamic Scope: A variables value is determined by the first value with the same identifier poped off the stack. ie 
x = 10;
func foo();
	int x = 4;
	print x;
this would print 4.


questions
1. A struct allocates space for all of its members, while a union only allocates space for the largest size one. This saves space and ensures that you process values one at a time. It uses a union because it may need to be a float, int, char *, or some other type.
2. yytext is a buffer, meaning refering to it at a different time may yield a very different result. 
3. This is usually because your grammer is ambigious in some way. A shift/reduce conflict means there is a moment where it could shift a statment over, or reduce the statment further
ie if <stmt> then <stmt>
if<stmt> then <stmt> else <stmt>
bision will default to the shift, but can be told which to do by %expect
reduce reduce is when there are two reduction possiblites. 
ie sequence: empty | sequence words | sequence redirects
words: empty| words word| word
redirects: empty | redirect | redirects redirect
empty can be reduced many possible ways. 
shift/shift would be two possible expression shifts

4. Name: the name of the var. also called lvalue
address: the memory location it is stored
value: the contents of the memory location
type: how the data is viewed, chars and ints are interpreted very differently
lifetime: how long the variable exists. local vars in functions exist only during the function call
scope: where a variable is visible. A variable may still be 'alive' but certain classes or function cant access because it is beyond their scope.
